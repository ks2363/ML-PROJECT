Diabetes Prediction Model

This project aims to develop a predictive model for diagnosing diabetes in female patients aged 21 or older, specifically of Pima Indian heritage.
By identifying key patterns and relationships between these features and diabetes diagnosis, this model provides an efficient tool for early detection and management of diabetes in high-risk populations.
